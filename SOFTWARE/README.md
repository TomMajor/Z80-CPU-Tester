# Z80 CPU Tester Firmware

## Compilation of Firmware for hardware v1 and v2

Use `zmac` to compile the assembler source:
```
zmac --oo cim,hex,lst <file>
```
The `cim`-File is a binary file that can be used to program a 27C256 EPROM or AT29C256 EEPROM.

In the subfolders a ready to use binary can be found.

## Result table (Excel file)

The Excel file contains the results from several Z80 CPUs. Additions are welcome.
